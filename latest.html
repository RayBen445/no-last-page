        The silence between pages hums louder than usual today.  
        Something felt, not said—an emotion that won’t shape itself into words.  
        If there’s meaning here, it hasn’t revealed its face yet.  
        But the moment has been recorded, and that is enough.

        This entry marks another step in the unfolding narrative,  
        one that doesn’t ask for conclusion—only continuation.
